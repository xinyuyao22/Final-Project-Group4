This README file should explain what order codes need to be run in (e.g., codes to fetch data should be run first, then code to preprocess, and then modeling, etc.) and a short description of what each script does.

##1 Feature Engineering.py
##2 Decision tree.py
##3 Random forest.py
##4 K-nearest neighbor.py
##5 Naive Bayes.py
##6 Use "newData_select.csv" to run JYG-GUI.py (models have already in this .py file)
